# BlobGame
#Created a single player game in Java. Various sized ‘blobs’ travel through the screen. The player controls a single circle which should dodge blobs larger than itself but consume ones of a smaller size to become larger. Graphics, JPanel, KeyListener, extensions, and implementations were used for project development.
